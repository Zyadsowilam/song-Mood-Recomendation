#Real-Time Mood-Based Song Recommendation System

This project is a real-time song recommendation system that suggests music based on user mood. It uses reinforcement learning to adjust recommendations according to user feedback. The system leverages spectrograms  for mood analysis and cosine similarity for initial song suggestions, making it an innovative and responsive music recommender.

Features

Real-time mood detection: Provides recommendations based on live feedback.

spectogram analysis: Analyzes the mood of songs.

Cosine similarity: Calculates song similarities to generate recommendations.

Reinforcement learning: Learns user preferences through feedback to improve recommendations over time.
